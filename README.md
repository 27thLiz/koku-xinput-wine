koku-xinput-wine
================

Adds xinput support to wine, without changing the source of wine.


Usage:

     [user@host game]$export LD_PRELOAD=/lib-path/koku-xinput-wine.so
     [user@host game]$wine game.exe
     
Simple Elegance, without patching wine.
Of course it would be wiser to put this code into wine..
